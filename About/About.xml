  <description><![CDATA[Patch pack for Vanilla Animals Expanded that includes patches for A Dog Said and Combat Extended for the current releases (Livestock - Cats & Dogs).

- This pack is incompatible with Thecc's VAE Livestock CE patch because it does the same thing only that this one has all the tools (body parts) patched your choice.

  <b>Contains patches for:</b>
  A Dog Said
  Combat Extended
  
  <b>Credits:</b>
  Oskar Potocki - Vanilla Animals Expanded
  Animal Collab Proj - Used some of their numbers]]></description>
